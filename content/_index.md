# Get In Tune
Our bodies are like a musical instrument. Daily stress, accidents, injuries and trauma creates noise in our energy field which puts us into an out-of-tune state. This noise, or stuck emotional energy, can be limiting us or causing us physical issues. 

Through daily practices like meditation, improving our diet, exercise, being mindful of where and how we spend our energy physically, mentally and emotionally, we can bring ourselves into a state of harmony. When we know how to do this, we have mastered our vibration.

Join the Master Your Vibration (MYV) newsletter to get updates on what I am doing with sound and vibration. Also, I occasionally send out information that I find helpful to mastering your vibration.
